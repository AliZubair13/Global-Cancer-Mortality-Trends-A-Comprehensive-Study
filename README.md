# Global-Cancer-Mortality-Trends-A-Comprehensive-Study
I‚Äôve built an Interactive Global-Cancer-Mortality-Trends Dashboard using D3.js (JavaScript) that combines data visualization with The Anatomy of Cancer: Organ-Specific Insights Dashboard, Global Cancer Mortality Trends (1990 - 2019): Time Series Shifts, Trends in Mortality Rates of Top 10 Cancer Types (1990‚Äì2019): Time Series Shifts, Impact of Medical Advancements over Cancer Mortality Rates (1990 - 2019): Time Series Shifts, Global Dashboard for Cancer Death Trends (1990‚Äì2019): Curable vs. Chronic - A Case Study, Interactive Geo Visualization of Global Cancer Death Rates (1990-2019): Trends and Geographic Shifts, Top 10 Countries with Maximum Cancer Deaths, Countrywise Cancer Death Analysis Dashboard

What does it do?
Visualizes the impact of cancer across vital human organs.
ü•ß Displays organ-specific cancer cases in a pie chart, including their contribution percentages.
üåç Highlights the top countries affected by organ-specific cancer cases on a dynamic, interactive globe.
We have visualizations collectively provide a comprehensive analysis of global cancer mortality trends from 1990 to 2019. The time-series charts reveal that global cancer death rates have generally increased over the years, with varying trends among the top 10 cancer types. Medical advancements, such as the introduction of new therapies, are highlighted as critical factors influencing mortality declines for specific cancers, showcasing their impact at key time points. The comparative analysis of curable versus chronic cancers via interactive pie charts demonstrates distinct temporal patterns, with curable cancers showing more significant mortality reductions over time. Dynamic features like tooltips and year sliders across all visualizations enable detailed exploration of trends, enhancing user understanding. Overall, the visualizations provide valuable insights into global cancer mortality dynamics, emphasizing the importance of medical innovation and category-specific trends in shaping outcomes.
